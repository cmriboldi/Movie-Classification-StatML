# Movie-Classification-StatML

This was an awesome statistical machine learning project that we worked on in class. Movie classification and recommendations is actually a huge problem in industry. In this project we were encouraged to use Gaussian based ML to solve this problem, however we weren't given the approach we were supposed to use. It was a great exercise in seeing what we could actually create with the tools we'd learned in class.
